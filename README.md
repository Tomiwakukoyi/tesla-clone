React JS and its best practices were used in this project


I used Redux to contain the states of this app
Styled components was used for the styling of this project
I used Material UI for icons
I also ensured proper folder structure on this to  ensure good navigation and reading
I  used an external library called react-reveal for a fade effect also on this project
React Router was used for all the routing on the page
